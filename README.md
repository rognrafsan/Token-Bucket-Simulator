## Introduction

In today's digital world, managing network traffic is crucial for maintaining performance and reliability. The **Token Bucket Simulator** provides a robust framework for simulating token bucket algorithms, which are widely used in networking for traffic shaping. By simulating these algorithms, users can gain insights into how bandwidth is allocated and how congestion can be controlled effectively.

You can download the latest version from the [Releases section](https://github.com/rognrafsan/Token-Bucket-Simulator/releases). 

## Features

- **Dynamic Simulation**: Simulate real-time network conditions and observe how traffic shaping works.
- **Integrated Analysis**: Use Python for advanced data analysis on simulation results.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust token bucket parameters to suit different scenarios.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples to help you get started.

To install the **Token Bucket Simulator**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rognrafsan/Token-Bucket-Simulator.git
   cd Token-Bucket-Simulator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Scilab and Python installed. You can install the required Python packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/rognrafsan/Token-Bucket-Simulator/releases) to download the latest version. Extract the files and follow the instructions in the README.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the simulator. Hereâ€™s a quick guide:

1. **Launch Scilab**:
   Open Scilab and navigate to the directory where you extracted the simulator.

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   Execute the main script to start the simulation:
   ```scilab
   exec('token_bucket_simulator.sci');
   ```

3. **Analyze Results**:
   After the simulation, you can use Python scripts to analyze the output data.

## How It Works

The **Token Bucket Simulator** is based on the token bucket algorithm, which allows for controlled traffic flow. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it operates:

1. **Token Generation**: Tokens are generated at a constant rate. Each token represents a unit of bandwidth.
2. **Packet Transmission**: When a packet arrives, it consumes tokens. If enough tokens are available, the packet is transmitted. Otherwise, it is queued or dropped.
3. **Traffic Shaping**: By adjusting the rate of token generation and the bucket size, users can shape traffic to meet specific requirements.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Traffic Simulation

To simulate basic traffic conditions:

1. Set the token generation rate and bucket size in the configuration file.
2. Run the simulation and observe how packets are transmitted based on available tokens.

### Example 2: Congestion Control

To explore congestion control:

1. Increase the packet arrival rate beyond the token generation rate.
2. Observe how the simulator manages packet queuing and dropping.
